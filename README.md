===============
Guide: Prof. Varsha Apte, CSE Department, IIT Bombay

Programming Language Used: C++

The project is a graphical application made on Qt, which solves the famous 8-Puzzle using two algorithms -- A* and IDA*, and 2 heuristics -- Manhattan Distance and Number of misplaced tiles.
It checks if the puzzle is solvable before actually solving, shows all the steps of solution, time taken to solve the puzzle and also animates the solution steps. 
It also has feature of shuffling the tiles to generate a random puzzle.
